## Strategy and Principles

- DRY
- Software Patterns (Visitor, Strategy)
    - I am pretty unsure as to what exactly I have used, as it's kinda a mix between the two(?). Or maybe I just can't differentiate between the two.
- OCP + ISP
- avoiding "else" and reducing if's
- TellDontAsk ("Update Item")
